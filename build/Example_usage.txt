Example usage for CudaDecon.  Assumes that you've copied the files into e:\Cuda.  Also assumes that you've navigated to the folder that contains either the PSF (for the OTF gen) or the data (for the decon/deskew) from a command prompt.  Otherwise, you will have to put in the relative path to the files from wherever you are in the command prompt.


Make the OTF:

e:\Cuda\otfgen.bat mbPSF_560_NAp5nap42_z100nm.tif mbOTF_560_NAp5nap42_z100nm.tif

Process the data (note that the path to the OTF file is the relative path from the current directory):

e:\Cuda\cudaDeconv -z .36 -D 32.8 -R 32.8 -i 10 -M 0 0 1 -S --input-dir . --filename-pattern sample_scan_560_20ms_zp36_cell1 --otf-file ../mbOTF_560_NAp5nap42_z100nm.tif --NoBleachCorrection --Pad 20

Note that you will need a GPU with enough memory to process the dataset.  I've tested it on a GPU with 6gb of memory and it runs.  Also, note that the file extension is required for the OTF, but should not be included in the name/string for the image.  The image string is just a character match, so it will process all files in the folder containing that string.

If multiple GPUs, GPU device can be selected with --GPUdevice.  Devices can be enumerated with the --DevQuery flag, or by running the deviceQueryDrv.exe

Also note, you can type cudaDeconv -h for a list of available parameters.
