DLL build instructions:

1. Prerequisites:
1.a. FFTW3 library installed in C:\fftw3
1.b. TIFF library installed in C:\libtiff
1.c. CMAKE v2.6 and later
1.d. CUDA SDK

2. Generate makefiles:
2.a. Make a subdirectory under where the source code (or this README) is located; let's call it "build"
2.b. Open a Windows SDK command prompt window and cd into the "build" directory just created
2.c. At the prompt type 

cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G "NMake Makefiles" ..

Make sure there's no error message. To generate makefiles from scratch, the entire content of "build" folder has to be deleted first.

3. Compile the libraries and executables:
At the prompt, type the following in that order:
nmake Buffer
nmake libcudaDeconv
nmake RL_interface_driver

4. The DLL is created as libcudaDeconv.dll in the "build" folder, and RL_interface_driver.exe is an executable to test the DLL. Run it like this:

RL_interface_driver.exe ..\cell3_ch0_stack0000_568nm_000000msec.tif ..\CBCotf.tif

A new file called debug.tif will be generated.
